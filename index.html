        Three more French-built Rafale fighter jets landed recently at Jamnagar Air Force Station (AFS) in Gujarat from
        the Istres Air Base in France. The three Omni fighter aircraft completed the 10-hour, 7,000 km journey to India
        with mid-air refuelling over the Gulf of Oman by an Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker (MRTT) belonging to
        the UAE Air Force. They will be inducted into the Indian Air Force’s No 17 Squadron, also known as the ‘Golden
        Arrows’, at Ambala AFS, which now has 14 Rafales, including the just landed fighters. The IAF’s second squadron
        of Rafale fighters will be stationed at Hashimara base in West Bengal.
